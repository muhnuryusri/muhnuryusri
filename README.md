Hello! I'm Muhammad Nur Yusri. Just call me Yusri
Currently I'm studying at Universitas Negeri Makassar, majoring in Computer Engineering degree.
I'm really interested about tech development, especially on Mobile (Android) Development, Full-Stack Development (Both Front-End and Back-End), Artificial Intelligence, and also UI/UX Design.
I'm currently learning about Mobile Development, using Kotlin as my main programming language.
